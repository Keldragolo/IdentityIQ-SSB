<Rule language="beanshell" name="Approval Assignment Rule" type="ApprovalAssignment">  
	<Description>
     This example rule switches all of the owners to spadmin.  The idea 
     of this rule is to allow some customization of the approvals 
     so the ownership can be cacluated for cases where you might
     use and exteneded attribute or some other means outside our
     default mechanisms to derive the owner of the Approval.
     
     This rule is typically configured on the Approval Step
     in the LCM Provisioning Workflow or can be set on any
     steps based on the "Provisioning Approval" step 
     library.
